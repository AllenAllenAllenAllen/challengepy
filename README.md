## New Feature Implementation
Let users post comments where they can describe their experiences about specific clubs.
I implemented by creating a new collection called "comment" in MongoDB, which has three fields: "username", "club" and "comment".

## Bonus Challenges
1. (POST /api/club) In addition to creating a new club, updates to existing clubs are also allowed.
2. (Database Management) All information needed for the app is stored in MongoDB.

## Additional Comments
For each API, I did very rigorous check on the parameter format and content.
